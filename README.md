# Bird Species Classification with ResNet50

This repository contains a machine learning project for classifying bird species using the ResNet50 architecture. The model has been trained and tested using TensorFlow and Keras on a dataset of bird images. The project includes code for training the model, evaluating its performance, and making predictions on new images.

## Project Structure

- `train_model.py`: Script to define, train, and save the ResNet50 model.
- `predict_image.py`: Script to load the trained model, make predictions on new images, and display the results.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `best_model.keras`: The saved model file.
